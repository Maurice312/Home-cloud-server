first thing first 

steps we nned to take:
1. wipe each one of our old computer 
2. figure out which distro we are going to use (I'm thinking Debian or NixOS just because we have alot countermeasure for dealing with corruption, Error and back ups
3. research time: we need to do alittle research on alot of thing for this to work such as:
    a. we going to need to re-learn unix enviroments 
    b.re-ansible some yaml and ansible 
    c. you need remind your self of some network protocols
